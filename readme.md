# Carvana-Image-Segmentation-Using-UNET
### Masking of Car Images using PyTorch and deployed using Heroku
The model architecture used is [UNET](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597v1) which is trained using PyTorch, with the final model being converted to ONNX format and deployed using Heroku.




## Dataset 📂
Dataset used from Kaggle [Carvana Image Masking Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/carvana-image-masking-challenge) which contains a large number of car images (as .jpg files). Each car has exactly 16 images, each one taken at different angles.
